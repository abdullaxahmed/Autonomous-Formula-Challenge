# Autonomous-Formula-Challenge

## Overview
This project showcases a small-scale autonomous formula car developed for the Open Robotics International Competition (ORIC) and the Global Robotics Challenge (GRC). The system is designed to navigate racing tracks fully autonomously by adjusting its steering and velocity based on real-time sensor input.

At the core of the speed control system is a fuzzy logicâ€“based decision model that continuously interprets 1D LiDAR data to adapt the vehicle's velocity based on track conditions. Steering is handled through a custom rule-based algorithm that calculates direction by analyzing lateral distance differences.

### Key objectives:
- Achieving smooth and reactive navigation on curved tracks
- Maintaining optimal speed through adaptive control
- Demonstrating robust performance in a competitive autonomous racing scenario
